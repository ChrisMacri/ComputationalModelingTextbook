    "### Analysis\n",
    "Analysis is always the first step in solving the problem. We start with asking hwat kind of model needs to be built for this problem. The model is definitely a continuous space model -- position of the particle is a continuous variable. The model is also deterministic -- there's not a stochastic element present. However, the next question -- whether the model is dynamic or static -- is already harder. At the first glance, this is a dynamic model, since we are talking about *motion* of a charge. On the other hand, we are being asked only about the final equilibrium position. Then maybe this is a static model after all -- we only need to know where the charge comes to rest. IN fact, one can solve the model both ways: either by writing down the equations of motion, modeling the motion, and then seeing where the charges settle, or by finding the equlibrium position directly, which is what we will do here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, whether we decide to solve this as a dynamic or as a static model, to ensure that there is a resting point for the charge, there has to be friction, so that the particle does not keep oscillating infinitely. Nothing is mentioned about this in the problem formulation -- but it seems like this is presumed. If we were to write a report about this problem, we would definitely need to mention this consideration  as a part of our discussion of the problem setup. Is friction the only thing we need? Is it guaranteed that with friction the particle will come to a rest? Same sign particles repel. And the repulsion is stronger when they come closer. So a particle between two other fixed one will be pushed away from both ends -- it seems reasonable that it will come to an equilibrium point at some time if friction robs it of energy. So the solution will exist -- it now makes sense to proceed to finding it by building the model."

    "### Model building\n",
    "The equilibrium for the system will be given by $\\sum \\vec{F}=0$, so that if a particle has zero velocity at this point (which the friction will achieve), it stays there. Since the particle is moving on a rod -- in one dimension -- this is equivalent to $\\sum {F}=0$. There are two Coulomb forces acting on the particle from the two end charges. Let's say the charges are at positions $p_1$ and $p_2$, and have charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ respectively. Let's suppose $p_1<x<p_2$, where $x$ is the position of the moving charge. The forces acting on the moving charge, which we call $q$ are then $\\sum F= \\frac{qq_1}{(x-p_1)^2}-\\frac{qq_2}{(x-p_2)^2}$. Thus to solve the problem, we need to solve the following equation for $x$: $\\frac{qq_1}{(x-p_1)^2}-\\frac{qq_2}{(x-p_2)^2}=0$, or, cancelling $q$, $\\frac{q_1}{(x-p_1)^2}-\\frac{q_2}{(x-p_2)^2}=0$. Interestingly, the only variables we need for initialization are the three charge values, and the two end charge positions -- the initial position of the moving charge, and charge value itself seem to be not needed. Multiplying the equation by the two denominators (which, luckily, cannot be zero), we get: ${q_1}{(x-p_2)^2}-{q_2}{(x-p_1)^2}=0$. Simplifying the equation, we get: $$(q_1-q_2) x^2 +2(-q_1p_2+q_2p_1)x+(q_1p_2^2-q_2p_1^2)=0 $$. So it seems that solving this problem is equivalent to solving a simple quadratic equation.\n",

    "### Model implementation\n",
    "As suggested earlier, to build a model, we start with large blocks describing chunks of the solution of the problem. We progressively break them apart into smaller and smaller blocks, until we are able to write the code for each one of the blocks. At the same time, as we are implementing the blocks, we collect pieces that need to be initialized in the initialization block, and need to be reported in the termination block. Here we realize that, in the previous lecture, we wrote a simple program that solves the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$. Thus implementing the model is equivalent to taking the previously written solution for the quadratic equation. Thus our implementation will consist of just three blocks: (1) initialization, where we assign  $a=q_1-q_2$, $b=2(-q_1p_2+p_2x_1)$, and $q_1p_2^2+q2p_1^2$; (2) solving the quadratic equation and getting its two solutions; and (3) termination, where, of the two solutions, we then output the one that falls between $p_1$ and $p_2$. \n",

    "### Model verification\n",
    "To verify that the solution is correct, we should try it in cases where the solution is easy to guess or to estimate otherwise, and compare. For example, we can try $q_1=q_2$, where it's clear that the solution should be $x=(p_1+p_2)/2$. We could also choose a few conditions with different $q_1$, and we would expect that growing $q_1$ should push the equilibrium farther from the left end.\n",
